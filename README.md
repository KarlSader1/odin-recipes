This project is all about practicing all of the HTML knowledge that 'The Odin Project' has taught me.
My goal is to create a basic recipe website which will include the use of:
- An HTML boilerplate
- Basic text such as heading, body, and paragraph text including making text bold/italicized where applicable
- Lists
- Links
- Images
The project will also be used to practice and perfect how I can write good and concise commit messages.
